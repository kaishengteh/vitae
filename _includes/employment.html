        <p>My first project was to upgrade 3 running factories as part of the companyâ€™s long-term strategic initiative 
            to stay competitive. I dealt with various stakeholders from equipment vendors to procurement specialists to 
            ensure no revenue loss due to missed schedule deliveries over 6 quarters. As a project engineer, I 
            successfully led new product introduction (NPI) projects where deliverables within budget and timeframe. 
            Lastly, I also took on additional responsibilities in budgeting and it was during this time that I developed 
            a strong interest in data analysis and modelling besides negotiation skills with vendors.</p>
