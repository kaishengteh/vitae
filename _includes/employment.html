        <p>Companies are turning to data as a strategic asset critical to success. As an analyst, I apply data mining and 
            statistics skills to monitor metrics, identify performance gaps and opportunities for optimization. Some of 
            the projects I led include formulating roadmaps to repurpose expensive machines for different products with 
            fast life cycles and consolidating consumable expenses resulting in lower operating cost. I also scrutinized 
            contracts enabling pricing team to increase profit margins for flagship products. Other than that, I also 
            assisted in tactical operations to recover revenue loss due to production hiccups. Ultimately, my main task 
            is to collaborate with various stakeholders to make sure our objectives are aligned with the organization 
            while constraints are respected.</p>

        <p>My role as an analyst was to develop the algorithms to improve model simulation accuracy using business 
            insights and data generated on the production floor. Predictive analytics was adopted to promote informed 
            decision making and ensure resources are allocated efficiently. With collaboration among cross-functional 
            teams to drive key strategic metrics, the team was able to accelerate capacity expansion for high margin 
            products. The team also achieved significant cost reduction through implementation of lean concept to 
            strengthen risk management process, develop mitigation plan and facilitate conflict resolution. Lastly, 
            I helped to coach 2 junior engineers to support new factory setup.</p>

        </header>
        <p>My first project was to upgrade 3 running factories as part of the companyâ€™s long-term strategic initiative 
            to stay competitive. I dealt with various stakeholders from equipment vendors to procurement specialists to 
            ensure no revenue loss due to missed schedule deliveries over 6 quarters. As a project engineer, I 
            successfully led new product introduction (NPI) projects where deliverables within budget and timeframe. 
            Lastly, I also took on additional responsibilities in budgeting and it was during this time that I developed 
            a strong interest in data analysis and modelling besides negotiation skills with vendors.</p>
