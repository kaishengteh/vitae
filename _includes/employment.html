        <p>Companies are turning to data as strategic assets critical to their successes. As a data analyst, I apply 
            data mining and statistics skills to monitor metrics, identify performance gaps and realize productivity 
            improvement. Some of the projects I led include formulating roadmaps to repurpose underutilized tools, 
            consolidating consumables usage, minimizing revenue leakage and driving operation teams to meet production 
            ramp-up milestones. I also assist in tactical operations to recover revenue lost due to production hiccups. 
            Ultimately, my main task is to collaborate with various stakeholders to make sure our objectives are 
            aligned while constraints are respected.</p>

        <p>My role was to develop algorithms to improve model simulation accuracy using business insights and data 
            generated on the production floor to promote informed decision making. I collaborated with cross-functional 
            teams to drive key strategic metrics and implement "lean" concept to reduce new tool purchase. Some of my 
            achievements include helping pricing team to negotiate for higher profit margins, training less experienced 
            colleagues and driving benchmarking across 5 global sites. </p>

        <p>I started as a project engineer dealing with various stakeholders to implement new products transfer and 
            coordinate the upgrades of 3 running factories. As the project scaled, I took on additional responsibilities 
            in budgeting where I collaborated with the corporate finance and procurement teams to build financial models 
            to better manage cash flow. It was during this time that I developed a strong interest in data analysis and 
            modelling.</p>
